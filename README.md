# React-Interactive-ScoreCard-
A JavaScript app that utilizes React creating DOM elements with props, state, Class and App Components to create an interactive Scorecard that not only increases and decreases score but lets you add and remove players as well as keep time with a built in stopwatch. The style is done with CSS. The initial board will show 4 players labeled player 1-4 with scores that start at 0. 

The best way to use this app if using locally, is through a local http server (ie python -m http.server) or through npm/node
